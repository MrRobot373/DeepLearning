# Deep-Learning
# 🚀 GitHub repository on Deep Learning! 🌟

I've compiled a comprehensive set of projects that leverage state-of-the-art architectures and techniques, including ANN, CNN, LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, GoogleNet, and YOLO. These projects cover a diverse range of applications such as:

🔢 MNIST Digit Recognition: Classic dataset for handwritten digit classification.

🌿 Plant Leaf Disease Detection: Identifying diseases in plant leaves to aid in agricultural diagnostics.

👁️ Diabetic Retinopathy: Using deep learning to detect diabetic retinopathy in retinal images.

📦 Object Detection: Implementing YOLO for real-time object detection tasks.

🎨 CIFAR-100 Image Classification: Tackling the challenging CIFAR-100 dataset with advanced CNN architectures.

Each project includes detailed documentation and code to help you understand and implement these models. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an experienced practitioner seeking inspiration, there's something here for everyone.
